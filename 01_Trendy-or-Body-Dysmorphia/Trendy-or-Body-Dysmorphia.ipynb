    "When it came to data acquisition I knew I had to be very careful. The way I see it is this: just because I can take it, it does not mean that I should take it. When finding data I had to ensure that I was following guidelines as best as I could. Data use guidelines varies from country to country, and there are many different licenses - therefore it is awfully easy for the lines to get blurred. In addition, the internet can only be policed to a certain extent, so it leaves the door open to moral conflict.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When starting a prosposal in which I acquire and analyse some data, I had to be mindful of its reach. Who was going to have access to my analysis, and what would they do with it. What were there intentions? Could my exploratory data analysis contain sensitive information? How would someone feel to see their personal data being used and deconstructed on the internet?  \n",
    "\n",
    "My first question was whether I was allowed to take the data. I extracted some data from The Annie E. Casey Foundation, who are a \"*charitable foundation focused on improving the well-being of American children according to their ideals.*\" \\[3\\]. Due to their drive to improve the livelihood of american children, I was allowed to obtain this data, as their organisation aims to educate, and by sharing data they hope that they can do just that. Is the data as thorough as the data that would come from another site, which isn't very clear about their licensing, or who impose restrictions- no. That being said, it all boils down to the principle, yes the data is a lot more extensive- but the lines around extracting it are blurry- I don't want to extract data that is restricted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I also questioned the bias of the data that I had acquired. Was the study large enough? Was it diverse? If not, how could it represent an entire population that is millions of time larger and very much diverse? I mentioned earlier that it was hard to find data that fit my proposal topic. In addition, it was hard to find data from a large study. This poses the question, can the data I have acquired be valid? Shouldn't it be deemed analagous due to its small nature, perhaps only that small group of people felt that way, what if the study was double the size, will the results be completely different? I suggested diversity above, could a lack of diversity introduce bias, and what impact does this have on people, or on an organisation."

    "In the bar chart above, I saw that the never bar was the highest for all other sources of news but social media. This meant that Generation Z's primary source of news was from social media. Taking a further look at the social media section, I came to realise that 50% of those who use social media as a news source, actually check the news daily. As opposed to the 5% of Newspapers users who check daily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest never bar aside from social media (6%) was online new sources which was at 29%. Based of the results from this study, I saw that the most common news sources were internet based, and social media was the most used as a news source.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What did this tell me? This brought about a lot of questions as social media is not very reliable because it is not monitored. At least with some of the other news sources, there has to be some checks that they go through. This is a demonstration of the way in which traditional news forms have adapted. A lot of newpapers have moved online, or have found other ways distributing the news, and so have their clientele.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What does this have to do with the influence of the media? This displayed just how dependent Generation Z is on social media. It is the main source of news for a high portion of them, with the other half mostly being internet based too. Without social media many would lose their connection to the news. It also illustrated the level of trust that they had for social media, as to take in news regularly from a particular source, you have trust that the information is somewhat factual. "

This is a concept that has been around for a while, technology just amplified it. People spend their time browsing through social media comparing what they see, to who they are. It is a vicious cycle, everyone posts theirselves at there best, no one wants to share their downfalls, unless they can make a joke out of it. Having grown up in ever tech growing world Generation Z have faced the brunt of it. The generation grew up sharing information online. What impact has that left on their mental health?"

    "The pie chart above is a visual representation of the table just above it. According to the figure about 2/3 of Generation Zers spend between 1 and 5 hours on social media, with 3.8% of them spending over 5 hours, and 17.4% spending less than 1 hour.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the above data we can see that about 66% of Generation Z spend 1 hours to 5 hours on social. This doesn't seem like such a large number. Though I would like to mention that there is a big difference between 1 hour and 5 hours, 5 hours is exactly 5 times the amount of time- which is a huge difference. To improve on the validity of the data, and to give more detailed data, I believe that the study should have been conducted with smaller categories. I feel as though the jump from 1 to 5 is simply to large.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What I took from this data, was that Generation Z spent a moderate time on social media. I know from reading the source of the data, that those who took part are on the older half of the Generation (18-24). This means that they were possibly working full time, or perhaps studying full time. This suggests that they didn't have as much time to spare on spending hours upon hours on social media. That being said, I saw earlier that they use social media very frequently (majoritity more than 10 times a day).

    "The data shows that there is a fair bit of activities that Generation Z do online, as the majority of the data was over 80%. On the lower end 22% of the correspondents reported selling goods or services over the internet. This led me to believe that the internet was used more for fun activities, or as a way to take a break. As most of the activities were not heavily connected to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, 94% of correspondents checked/sent emails, and who's to say that they weren't work emails. However, it seemed that there was a lot of ambiguity from the data. There was not necessarily more that could have been done, it was just the nature of the categories- they were not very specific. Although if they had been too specific the data wouldn't have been accurate or representative anymore. I believed that formulating an analysis on this would lead to a lot of bias, as there would have been a lot of assumptions from the one analysing, as the data wasn't very niched. \n",

    "All in all, it was pretty hard to come to a solid conclusion from this data, there were more things that I would have needed to know to reach a valid conclusion. But what was quite clear was that most Generation Zers spend time on social networking sites."

    "In the chart above it was clear that there was an increase in the number of users on the various social platforms. This was very representative of the world that we are living in today, being that it is a rapidly growing technological world. However, I decided to look at the data more closely, seeing as they were all increasing, and set to continue increasing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that there was a significant difference in users (around 10 million) between the purple (Pinterest), brown (Twitter), pink (Reddit) group, and the blue (Snapchat), green (TikTok), orange (Instagram), red (Facebook) group. This led me to consider what these groups each had in common. I came to the realisation that the group that had the more users (blue group) were the social platforms that had an emphasis on short videos, as opposed to being more text based, with pictures and videos here and there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Point to mention- the highest of the lower group was Pinterest, which is set to continue increasing in users steadily. Pinterest is more visual based than the other two, though it lacks as much social interaction- the concept of short videos has slowly been introduced onto the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is that the case? Why are Generation Zers choosing videos and pictures, over more text-based platforms. I had an inkling that it was due to two main things. One that videos are more personal, and two because humans are visual beings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have gotten very far in technology, and that has expanded to how we share online. More and more people are using filters or are editing their pictures before posting them. While videos can still be edited, and people can use filters, videos still come across as more authentic. There are also the perfect way for people to share short clips, vlog about their lives. In addition, humans are very visual and seeing things helps the experience feel more real. Many people who follow strangers online feel as though they know those strangers, due to images and video content that they have shared online.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What can we infer from this? Upon analysing the data I realised that there could be a connection between the visual nature of humans and body dysmorphia or body comparison. Body comparison is inevitable when people use such visual platforms where people post their best angles."

All in all, I concluded that most users were ghosting, a colloquial term in social media that meant that they were simply just observing but not contributing to what they observed. They kept their social platforms so they could get insight on what was happenning around the world- since we saw earlier that, that was their primary news source. In addition, they keep it so that they can be kept up to date with what is trending, where they get fed a ton of perfection through media, leading to a vicious cycle of body comparison."

    "The graph above shows that the number of Generation Zers that suffer from anxiety has not been very constant. There was a peak around Oct to Nov 2020, which could be attributed to the pandemic. Analysing this brought me to the conclusion that there were two ways that I would want to look at the data. First, by ignoring the peaks caused by a global pandemic, as people are bound to become more anxious, and then by looking at the whole data including the peaks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By ignoring the peaks, I concluded that on average 40% of Generation Z suffered from anxiety- which is incredibly high. Including the peaks brought the average up to about 45%, with the max at one point having been 50%. This meant that there was a time when 1 in 2 Generation Zers suffered from anxiety, which is a collosal amount of people.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the cause of their anxiety? We have already seen that they have spent a lot of their time online, and that many compare theirselves to others, all these things are catalysts for anxiety. Though I wasn't able to say for certain that technology was the main cause of their anxiety, I was able to conclude that it plays a large role in causing it, or perhaps adding to it."

    "From the chart above I inferred that the number of those that had depression had been increasing over the month until a certain point. I assumed that this was due to an after affect of the pandemic, and that at the point where it dropped, the level of depression was slowly going back to the norm- though it looked to be rising again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this, it was very hard to draw a conclusion from this data. This proposal was about the impact of technology/internet/social media on mental health not a pandemic. I concluded that the data was accurate however not useful for what I was trying to find an answer too. I then decided to just focus on the part before the rapid jump, and came to this final conclusion. On average about 32% of Generation Z suffer from depression, which is almost 1 in 3, which is another pretty high stat. Therefore to some degree, there was plenty of truth behind my initial statement."

    "In terms of my objectives, I had originally set out to analyse the correlation between body dymorphia and social media with Generation Z, and eventually decided to broaden the proposal to media and technology as a whole, and their impact on the mental health of Generation Z- which I mentioned before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to analyse what I finally set out to, and I came to the conclusion that there was in fact a correlation. Though I will say that the strength of that correlation most definitely lies heavily on the data that you are able to acquire. I was able to attain a good amount of data that helped me reach my conclusion. Though I found that some of the data could have been impacted by other events that happened over the world, or other factors in general. This is because the data I attained wasn't as niched as I would have liked it to have been, in order to feel more confident with what I discovered- though I still believe that I reached a solid conclusion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I explored the forms of media that Generation Z take in, and also whether they were the most reliable forms of media to use. I also explored whether people that frequented social platforms more often, were more inclined to develop poor mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to have more time, I would go with my original objective, and spend a significant amount of time finding data, or perhaps even conducting surveys to acquire my own data. I believe that this was an important topic as many of this young generation are facing these things, as a result of their technologically influenced upbringing, and they are the hope for tomorrow, so it is in our best interest to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to improve on their mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of my aims, I set out to first find the data needed to explore my objects. I was able to successfully do this, though I do acknowledge some bias present in some of the data, due to smaller study sizes in some cases. There may also have been a lack in diversity in the data I collected too. However, I was still able to obtain some solid data, that was able to help me draw a conclusion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another of my aims was to consider the methods needed to extract said data and then extact it, which I did. I spent the majority of the extracting time scrapping data, and if I didn't scrap I extracted from excel spreadsheets. With that I achieved another of my aims, which was to clean the data so that I would be able to analyse it- which I did, and I was also able to pick up on strange patterns due to that. My final aim was to carry out exploratory data analysis by identifying links between data, and also potential flaws. I believe that I met this aim, though if I had more time, or I was to approach this again, there are more correlations that I would touch on, and I would also go into more detail, and use more tools."
